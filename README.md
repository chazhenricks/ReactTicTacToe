# React Tic Tac Toe
In an effort to teach myself Recact, I made a simple Tic Tac Toe game following the tutorial found [Here](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)

The app is a simple introduction to classes, components, states and props in React. 

It has been heavily commented to the best of my understanding. 
Feel free to follow along in the `src/index.js` file
